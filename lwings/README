Legendary Wings for PC
===============================================================================

A version of the NES game Legendary Wings for PC. It's only the first section
and no dungeons. It's made for Windows with OpenGL 1.1 and C with the binaries
compiled using MSVC6.

Audio is handled through the BASS library, with a slight panning effect while
at it, and textures are loaded using the LodePNG library. Indexed PNGs take
quite the little space for this kind of assets.
